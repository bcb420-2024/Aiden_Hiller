  abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html.},

               insight into gene lists generated from genome-scale (omics)
               experiments. This method identifies biological pathways that are
               enriched in a gene list more than would be expected by chance.
               We explain the procedures of pathway enrichment analysis and
               present a practical step-by-step guide to help interpret gene
               lists resulting from RNA-seq and genome-sequencing experiments.
               The protocol comprises three major steps: definition of a gene
               list from omics data, determination of statistically enriched
               pathways, and visualization and interpretation of the results.
               We describe how to use this protocol with published examples of
               differentially expressed genes and mutated cancer genes;
               however, the principles can be applied to diverse types of omics
               data. The protocol describes innovative visualization
               techniques, provides comprehensive background and
               troubleshooting guidelines, and uses freely available and
               frequently updated software, including g:Profiler, Gene Set
               Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Cytoscape and EnrichmentMap. The
               complete protocol can be performed in ~4.5 h and is designed for
